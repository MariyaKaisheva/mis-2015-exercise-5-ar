For the first task, a teapot object is rendered over the recognized picture.
This happens on the default mode (extended tracking off).

For the second task, we used professors office signs (Bauhausstra√üe 11).
Once the sign is recognized, the application shows the picture of the professor retrieved from the university website on top of the sign. In order to show the picture on a proper plane, the application must be on the extended tracking mode.
In the pictures folder, you can find the pictures of the recognized signs.
